### Objective

Write a program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime number.
* The program must run from the command line and print one table to
STDOUT.
* The first row and column of the table should have the 10 primes, with each
cell containing the product of the primes for the corresponding row and
column.


### Notes
This project was written with ruby 2.3.3 .You will need ruby 2.3 or above for this to work correctly.
If that is a problem there is just one change that would need to be made.

### Usage

`./bin/prime_tables`

or optionally add an argument to change the number of primes to output.

`./bin/prime_tables 15`
